# WASD Game - Multiplayer Cooperative Game

## 🎮 Game Concept

A unique multiplayer cooperative game where two players control a single character using different key sets. Players must work together to navigate through obstacles and avoid enemies, with the character continuing to move in the last input direction until a new direction is given.

## 🎯 Game Rules

1. **Two Player Multiplayer**: Two players control one character simultaneously
2. **Key Assignment**:
   - Player 1: Controls `W` (up) and `A` (left)
   - Player 2: Controls `S` (down) and `D` (right)
3. **Continuous Movement**: Character continues moving in the last input direction until another direction is pressed
4. **Collision Detection**: Game restarts when character hits walls or enemies
5. **Status Tracking**: Display death count and play time for each player

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
